## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to preprocess movie review data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. The following models are used:
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **`rt-polarity.pos`**: Contains positive movie reviews (one review per line).  
- **`rt-polarity.neg`**: Contains negative movie reviews (one review per line).  

### Example Review:

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
## Results

The models' performance on the test dataset:

| Model                 | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Naive Bayes**       | 75.8%    | 0.76      | 0.76   | 0.76     |
| **Logistic Regression** | 75.3%  | 0.75      | 0.75   | 0.75     |
| **SVM**               | 74.5%    | 0.74      | 0.74   | 0.74     |
